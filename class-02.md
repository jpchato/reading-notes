# Ch 2 Text

- Intro
  - **structural markup**
    - the elements that you can use to describe headings and paragraphs
  - **semantic markup**
    - provides extra info
- Headings
  - `<h1><h2><h3><h4><h5><h6></h#>`
  - Six levels at different sizes
- Paragraphs
  - `<p></p>`
  - Place around surrounding words you want to be a paragraph
  - Each paragraph begins on a new line with some space between paragraphs
- Bold and Italic
  - `<b></b><i></i>`
  - Bold presents text differently. Sometimes indicates keywords
  - Italics can represent text that would be said differently fromt the surrounding content.
- Superscript and Subscript
  - `<sup></sup><sub></sub>`
  - `<sup>` is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or for exponents
  - `<sub>` is used for subtext. Like chemical formulas H<sub>2</sub>O = H`<sub>`2`</sub>`O
- White Space
  - **white space collapsing** 
    - two or more spaces causes browsers to leave only one space
- Line breaks and Horizontal Rules
  - `<br  /><hr  />`
  - `<br  />`
    - Breaks a line and starts a new paragraph
  - `<hr  />`
    - Creates a line between text signalling a different topic
- Visual Editors and their code views
  - VS code
- Semantic markup
  - Text elements for the coder and code reader
  - Does not affect the code
  - e.g. `<!--x-->`
- Strong and emphasis
  - `<strong><em>`
  - strong is bold, em is italics
- Quotations 
  - `<blockquote><q>`
  - blockquote used for long quotes
  - browsers indent the blockquotes
  - `<q>` wraps quotation marks around text
- Abbreviations and acronyms
  - `<abbr>`
  - Use an acronym, but hovering over the acronym shows what the acronym means
- Citations and definitions
  - `<cite><dfn>`
  - Cite for books
  - defines new instance of a term
- Author details
  - embed an email address
  - `<address>`
- Changes to content
  - `<ins><del><s>`
  - show reader the changes
- Summary
  - HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page
  - They also provide semantic information

# Ch 10 Introducing CSS

- Intro
  - CSS allows you to style web pages
  - Cascading Style Sheets
- Understanding css: thinking inside the box
  - imagine an invisible box around every element
  - can style with box and inline elements
- CSS associates style rules with html elements
  - `p{
      font-family: Arial;}`
  - p is the selector
  - font-family: Arial is the declaration
- CSS properties affect how elements are displayed
  - font-family is the property
  - arial is the value
- Using external css
  - `<link>` a style page in the head of html document 
- Using internal css
  - style inside the html text
- CSS selectors
  - universal selector `*`, type selector `h1, h2, h3`, class selector `.note, p. note`, id selector `#`, child selector `li>a`, descendant selctor `p a`, adjacent sibling selector `h1+p`, general sibling selector `h1~p`
- How CSS rules cascade
  - Last rule overrides previous rules
  - more specific rules take precedence over broader rules. h1 is more specific than p
  - `!important` after any property value to indicate it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element
- Inheritance
  - attributes given to parent elements will be inherited by children elements (usually)
- Why use external style sheets?
  - Multiple web pages can share same sheet
  - Same code does not need to be repeated in every page
- Different versions of css and browser quirks
  - not all browsers are the same.  css will not always display the same way across browsers
- Summary
  - CSS treats each html element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look
  - rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should loo like)
  - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different eleemtns
  - Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties
  - CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an html page

  # Ch 2 Basic Javascript Instructions
  - Intro
    - How to give a browser instructions for it to follow
  - Statements
    - Each individual step is known as a **statement**
    - statements surrounded by curly braces `{}` are known as **code blocks**
  - Comments
    - **comments** help the coder understand what the code does
    - `//`
  - What is a variable?
    - Data
    - Scripts temporarily store data  that can be used for other functions
  - Variables: how to declare them
    - `var quantity;`
    - var = variable keyword
    - quantity =  variable name
  - Variables: how to assign them a value
    - `quantity = 3;`
    - quantity = variable name
    - = is assignment operator
    - 3 is variable value
  - Data types
    - Numeric data type
      - numbers (1,2,3,4,5...)
    - String data type
      - stuff in quotes 'seven', 'hello', 'howdy, what's your name' 
    - Boolean data type
      - true/false
  - Using a variable to store a number
    - Once a value has been assigned to a variable, you can use the variable name to represent the value
  - Using a variable to store a string
  - Using quotes inside a string
    - use escape characters to use qutoes inside strings
    - `\` before any type of quote mark that appears within a string
  - Using a variable to store a boolean
  - Shorthand for creating variables
    - `var price, quantity, total;`
    - don't have to write `var` three times
  - Changing the value of a variable
    - use function name and equal sign
  - Rules for naming variables
    - 6 rules for naming variables
      1. The name must being with a letter, dollar sign $, or an underscore. It must not start with a number
      1. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar signs, or an underscore. `-` and `.` not allowed in variable name
      1. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. 
      1. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names. Bad practice to create two variables with the same name but different capitalization
      1. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
      1. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. firstName, colorTacoNacho
  - Arrays
    - Store lists of variables
    - Use arrays when working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other
  - Creating an array
    - pg 71
    - Values are assigned to the array inside a pair of `[]` brackets and each value is separated by a `,` 
    - You can store a string, a number, and a boolean all in the same array
  - Values in arrays
    - Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an **index**
    - Index begins at 0
    - pg 72
  - Accessing and changing values in an array
    - `var[#] = 'text'`
    - Changes value in an array
  - Expressions
    - Evaluates into a single value
    - Expressions that jsut assign a value to a variable
    - Expressions that use two or more values to retun a single value
  - Operators
    - They allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
    - assignment operators, arithmetic operators, string operators, comparison operators, logical operators
  - Arithmetic Operators
  - Long list on p. 76
  - `+ - / * ++ -- %`
  - String Operator
    - `+` is the only string operator
    - Used to join strings on either side
    - **Concatenation** is the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string
  - Summary
    - A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
    - Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
    - Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script
    - Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information
    - JavaScript distinguishes between number (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false)
    -Expressions evaluate into a single value
    - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value

# Ch 4 Decisions & Loops
- Intro
  - You can create and control the flow of data in scripts to handle different situations
  - evaluations, decisions, and loops
- Decision Making
  - Flowcharts help plan for occassions where decisions need to be made in the script
  - **Condition** determines which path to take when a decision needs to be made.
- Evaluating conditions and conditional statements
  - Two components to a decision:
    1. An expression is evaluated, which returns a value
        - In order to make a decision, your code checks the current status of the script. This is commonly done by comparing two values using a comparison operator which returns a value of true or false
    2. A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation
        - A conditional statement is based on a concept of if/then/else; *if* a condition is met, *then* your code executes one or more statement, *else* your code does something different
- comparison operators: evaluating conditions
  - is equal to `==`
  - is not equal to `!=`
  - strict equal to `===`
  - strict not equal to `!==`
  - greater than `>`
  - less than `<`
  - greater than or equal to `>=`
  - less than or equal to `<=`
- Structuring comparison operators
  - `(score >= pass)`
  - `()` enclosing parentheses
  - score is the operand
  - `>=` is the comparison operator
  - pass is also an operand
- Using expressions with comparison operators
  - The operand can be an expression, because an expression evaluates into a single value
  - Kind of like math 
- Logical operators 
  - Logical and `&&`
    - If both expressions evaluate true then the expression returns true. If one is false, the whole it returns false
  - Logical or `||`
    - If either expression evaluates true then the expression returns true (even if one is false)
  - Logical Not `!`
    - Reverses the state of an expression
  - Comparison operators return single values of true or false (usually). However, logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator
- if statements
  - Evaluates or checks a condition
  - If condition evaluates true, statements in following code block are executed
- if...else statements 
  - checks a condition
  - If true first code block executed
  - if false second block executed
