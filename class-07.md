# Article: Domain Modeling
* Creating a conceputal model in code for a specific problem
* An object-oriented model stores data in properties and methods
* Use constructors to define properties between many objects
* Use function expression to define constructor function
* Use constructor functions to initialize and define properties
* Use small methods to model its behavior
* Store newly created objects in a variable so they can be accessed outside
* use the this. to access data from within an ojbect

# Tables
* Table cell
* `<table></table>`, `<tr></tr>`, `<td></td>`, `<th></th>`, `<thead></thead>`, `<tbody></tbody>`, `<tfoot></tfoot>`
* Summary
  * The `<table>` element is used to build tables for web sites
  * Tables are created row by row. Each row is created the the `<tr>` element
  * Each row has a `<td>` element or `<th>` if it is a header
  * Use `colspan` attributes to make cells of a table span more than one row or coolumn
  * For long tables you can split tables into `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`

  # Functions, Methods, and Objects p 106-144
  * `this` is a keyword-accesses data within an object
  * global scope/context-when a function is created at the top level of a script OUTSIDE of a function
  * Arrays are objects
  * Object model
    * a group of objects, each of which represent related things
  * Summary
    * Functions allow users to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task
    * Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and mayr return a value (not always)
    * An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you
    * In an object, variables are known as properties of the objet; functions are known as methods of the object
    * Web browsers implement objects that represnt both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window
    * JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as `String, Number, Math, and Date`. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
    * Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and vice versa)
