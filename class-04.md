* relative url
  * When you link to other pages within the same site
* url
  * uniform resouce locator
  * consists of domain name followed by path to page or image
* path
  * where a file is located 
* root folder
  * top-level folder
  * contains all folders and files for a website
* index.html
  * web servers return this if no file name is specified
* ## summary
  * Links are created using the `<a>` element
  * The `<a>` element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to
  * If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs
  * You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field
  * You can use the id attribute to target elemnents within a page that can be linked to

# Ch 15 Layout p 358-404

* stacking context
  * z-index
* 960 pixel grid
  * widely used by designers
* ## summary
  * `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page
  * Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning
  * The `float` property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items requrie a defined width)
  * Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts
  * Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels )to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling)
  * Grids help create professional and flexible designs
  * CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks
  * You can include multiple CSS files in one page
