## Structure
* How pages use structure
  * Structure helps readers understand how information is divided 
* Structuring word documents
  * Heading and subheadings reflect hierarchy of information. Therefore, structure helps communicate to readers what is important.
* HTML describes the structure of pages
  * HTML code is made up of **elements**.
  * Elements are *usually* made up of two **tags**: opening and closing tags
* HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages
  * Tags are like boxes. They tell you something about the information contained between the opening and closing tags.
* A closer look at tags
  * `<p></p>`
  * < left-angle bracket, > right-angle bracket, p character, / forward slash, `<p>` opening tag, `</p>` closing tag
* Attributes tell us more about elements
 * Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element
 * They appear on opening tag of theleement and are made of two parts: **name** and **value** 
 * `<p lang="en-us"></p>` 
 * lang is the attribute name
 * en-us is the attribute value
* Body, head, & title
 * `<body></body>`
  * Everything between these tags in showing in the main browser window
 * `<head></head>`
  * This contains information about the page. 
  * Usually holds a `<title></title>` tag
 * `<title></title>`
  * Usually shown in top of browser or on page tab
* Creating a web page on a pc
* Code in a content management system
* Looking at how other sites are built
* Summary
  * HTML pages are text documents
  * HTML uses tags to give information special meaning 
  * Tags are referred to as elements
  * Tags come in pairs (usually). Opening and closing
  * Opening tags can carry attributes (but not always?)
  * Attributes need a name and value
